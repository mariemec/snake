Snake Application - S2 Project:

This little application is the 80's game Snake. Your goal is to eat as many fruits as you can without colliding with any of the sides or with the snake's tail. Use the arrows to move and switch directions. There's also a HighScore menu in which you can see the top scores.

Getting started:

Download this repository on your local computer. Make sure you have both VS2017 and Qt community installed (see prerequisites).

Prerequisites:

Visual Studio 2017 : https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/older-downloads/
QT community (open source): https://www.qt.io/download-open-source
For both of these, just follow the instructions given on the website. This application will only work on Windows OS.

Installing:

Set up the path in your envrionement variables for Qt tools: example -> C:\Qt\5.14.2\msvc2017_64\bin
Using VS2017's x64 Native Tools Command Prompt, use the qmake tool to generate a VS project using the snake.pro file.
-> qmake snake.pro
This should create a Visual Studio project that's already set up and ready to run.
Open the project and run it. An application window should pop up.
